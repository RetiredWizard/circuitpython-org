Omnimo nRF52840 is a compact development board that features the latest version of Nordic’s powerful nRF52840 multiprotocol SoC. This chip supports a wide array of wireless protocols, including Bluetooth Low Energy, Bluetooth mesh, NFC, Thread, Matter, and Zigbee. It is compatible with over 2,000 add-on boards from the Feather, Qwiic, mikroBUS, and Pmod ecosystems.

With its robust wired and wireless capabilities and user-friendly design, Omnimo nRF52840 is ideal for projects centered around mobile applications. It is also suitable for a wide range of electronic and IoT projects and is compatible with beginner-friendly environments like CircuitPython and the industrial SDK, nRF Connect.

Omnimo features a Feather socket, allowing you to choose from dozens of useful FeatherWing modules to meet your needs. It also supports Adafruit’s Feather pinout, so programs that work on other boards like the Feather nRF52840 Express can be used with Omnimo nRF52840.

Omnimo nRF52840 is equipped with a JST 4-position 1mm connector linked to the I2C port, also known as Qwiic or Stemma QT. With over 300 compatible modules available on the market, you can quickly connect one or more of them to the board in series. Additionally, you can use dozens of Grove (I2C) modules through this connector with an adapter cable (e.g. PRT-15109).

Digilent Pmods can also be connected directly to Omnimo nRF52840, allowing you to benefit from a wide range of available modules.
